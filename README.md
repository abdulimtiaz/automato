2. [Create a bot account on Discord and invite it to your server](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. Clone the repository onto your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/abdulimtiaz/automato` or download it from GitHub
4. Create a `token.txt` file in the local repository directory and paste your "client secret" (from Discord's Developer Portal in step 2) into the file
